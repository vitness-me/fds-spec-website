# Roadmap

This page outlines the future direction of the Fitness Data Standard. Items listed here represent areas we intend to address in future RFCs but are **not yet in active development**.

## Current Focus

**RFC-001 through RFC-005** establish the foundation:
- Exercise data model with classification, muscles, and equipment
- Equipment, muscle, and body atlas registries
- Extensibility via vendor namespaces

These RFCs are stable and ready for implementation.

## Planned Future RFCs

The following areas are out of scope for the initial release but are planned for future standardization:

### Workout & Programming Models
- Workout session structure (exercises, sets, reps, rest periods)
- Training program templates and periodization
- Workout history and logging format

### User Progress Tracking
- Personal records and achievements
- Body measurements and composition
- Performance metrics over time

### Authentication & Authorization
- API authentication patterns for FDS-compliant services
- Data sharing permissions and consent models
- Privacy-preserving data exchange

### Additional Domains
- Nutrition and meal planning integration
- Recovery and sleep data
- Wearable device data mapping

## Contributing to the Roadmap

Have ideas for future RFCs? We welcome community input:

1. **Open a discussion** on [GitHub](https://github.com/FDS-Spec/fds-spec) to propose new areas
2. **Submit an RFC draft** following the [contributing guidelines](/docs/governance/contributing)
3. **Share implementer feedback** about what standards would help your platform

## Timeline

We do not commit to specific dates for future RFCs. Development is driven by:
- Community demand and feedback
- Implementer needs
- Volunteer contributor availability

Watch the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FDS-Spec/fds-spec) for updates on RFC progress.
