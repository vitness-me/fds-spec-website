# FDS Examples

This section provides example data and implementation guides for the Fitness Data Standard.

## Example Registry Data

All reference data (exercises, equipment, muscles, muscle categories, body atlas) is available in JSON format:

- **Exercises**: `/registries/exercises.json`
- **Equipment**: `/registries/equipment.json`
- **Muscles**: `/registries/muscles.json`
- **Muscle Categories**: `/registries/muscle-categories.json`
- **Body Atlas**: `/registries/body-atlas.json`

## Example Entities

Each schema includes multiple example JSON files demonstrating different use cases:

### Exercise Examples
- Basic exercise definition
- Cardio exercise with specific attributes
- Mobility/flexibility exercise
- Machine-based exercise
- Unilateral exercise

### Equipment Examples
- Basic equipment definition
- Complex equipment with multiple pieces

### Muscle Examples
- Individual muscle with heatmap data
- Muscle with bilateral laterality
- Muscle with detailed classification
